1. Import the required libraries.
2. Load flight and hotel data.
3. Set the input variables (days, total price, location).
4. Perform data preprocessing.
5. Use a linear regression model to predict flight prices.
6. Calculate the total price considering the price of the hotel and the price of the flight.
7. Use decision trees and random forest classification models to predict destinations.
8. Output the results (MSE and MAE of linear regression, accuracy of decision tree, accuracy of random forest, predicted location).
